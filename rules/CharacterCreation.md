## Cards, Decks and Gear

## Point Buy

## No Class

LCRPG is a classless role playing game. When you create a character, you don't choose to be a "Wizard" or a "Fighter", like you would in
Dungeons and Dragons. Instead, you'll choose a **race** and a **background**, and build a character from there. Your race and background will
influence what cards you can choose and how you build your deck.
