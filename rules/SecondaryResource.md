# Momentum

Some cards in RPCG use a resource called Momentum. In $SETTING_NAME, some characters become more powerful as they get into the flow of battle. You'll find cards that generate Momentum, spend it, and cards that are more effective if you have enough of it. As an example, here's a few cards:

### Dynamic Entry

Major Action

You may move one space. Deal W damage to an adjacent target. If it's your first turn of this combat, generate 2 Momentum.

### Flurry of Blows

Major Action

Deal 3 damage X times, where X is your current Momentum.

### Haymaker

Major Action

Costs 2 Momentum. Deal 2 times W damage to an adjacent target.
