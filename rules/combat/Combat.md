# Combat
After wandering through the forest, you are set upon by a pack of wolves!

## Start of Combat
At the beginning of combat, your DM will set up the enemy combatants on the enemy side of the battelfield.  
Each enemy will have an initiative number marked on them. Enemies will always have odd initiative numbers, while allies will always be even.  
From here, we go to the highest initiative number.

## Start of Initiative number
When combat enters an initiative number, all effects that happen at the "start of turn" happen.  
If there are multiple effects, the DM decides which order they occur in.  
Then, if it is the first time this initiative has happened this combat the combatants at that initiative number decide which order they will take their turns in. Otherwise, they take their turns in the same order as they did on their previous turns.  

## Turns
At the start of each player turn, they draw N cards.  
Then, the combatant can use a major action and a minor action in any order.  
Once they have used their actions, or choose to not use their actions, their turn is over

## End of Initiative number
Once all the combatants for a given initiative have taken their turn, all effects that happen at the "start of turn" happen.  
If there are multiple effects, the DM decides which order they occur in.  
Then the initiative decreases to the next highest initiative. If there are no more initiatives, it instead goes back to the highest initiative.

## End of Combat
Once the combat's victory or loss conditions are met, the DM distributes any rewards for that combat, and the adventure continues!
