## Armor

Whenever an ability instructs you to deal deal damage, reduce the damage you would deal by the target's resistance to that type of damage.  
For example, you are swinging a sword at a goblin. Your sword deals 5 physical damage, but the goblin has physical resistance of 1. Your swing will deal 4 damage to the goblin.

In the same way, reduce damage you would take by your resistance. If an enemy mage is throwing a bolt of lightning at you, with a damage of 7 Lightning, but you are wearing rubber boots which provide 3 Lightning resistance, you would take 4 damage.
