# Playtesting Log

# Playtest Report Survey

## Basic Info

- Num. Players: 4
Erickson/Cass: Wizard
Clay: Warrior
Chris: Rogue
John: Cleric

## General Observations

- Movement feels somewhat unnatural on the lines
-- Can't move into enemy lines
- Wants more variety in cards
- Wizard deck didn't feel like it had enough minor actions
- Moving enemies didn't feel particularly satisfying, needs some other element
- Move magic might be too powerful
- Moving an ogre the same as a zombie seems odd

- Duel, feint, doubleslash felt great
- Block felt medium to play but was too good
- running out of cards felt appropriate

## Needs more testing

- 10 starting health?
- Might not need equipment to have Actions
- Healing is probably still to good?
- Mill as mental damage? alternate damage forms, ala hand attack.
- drawing 2 is too much, try 5 cards draw 1

## What Worked?

## What Didn't Work?

- How does a person on file 1 hit a person on file 3?
-- Major action zip?
