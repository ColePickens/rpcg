# Playtesting Log

# Playtest Report Survey

## Basic Info

- Num. Players: 2
Clay: wizard & cleric
John: Fighter & rogue

## General Observations

- draw 2 was good because it meant less perfect information
- perhaps have a section on "how we did it" for non pure system things, like tracking health in the rules
- feats as cards
  - feats are un removable
  - feats with downsides
  - incremental cost increases
  - limited feat slots?
- grinding through high DR/health incentivizes not using cards except to reduce actions
- we always forget to attach cards to the things they effect
  - better templating will probably help
  - Clear symbols will probably help

## Needs more testing

- sabotage/sleep probably too good against "bosses"
- templating semi-persistent effects

## What Worked?

## What Didn't Work?

- can't attach shifting earth to two creatures
- how to attach multiple effects to a target?
  - effect tokens? not pretty but would work
- movement needs a little more work
  - dash feels better than zip
  - how to resolve ending turn in another character's space?
    - just not allowed?
- clay did not intuit that you could both major action dash and minor action move
